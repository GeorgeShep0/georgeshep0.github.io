            Congratulations. You’ve arrived at a website that exists purely out of spite.
            Nothing here has a purpose. Nothing here is helpful. This page was assembled
            with the emotional maturity of a raccoon in a skip.

            Scientists agree this page should not exist. Designers deny involvement.
            Developers are “on holiday” and refuse to answer questions.
            Every second you spend here is a second you will never get back.
